                    <p class="texto_1"><strong>F1:</strong> Hi! This is Celeb Shock!, your best source for all the latest and hottest celebrity gossip!</p>
                    <p class="texto_2"><strong>M1:</strong> And we’ve got some great stories for you today! Right, Luisa?</p>
                    <p class="texto_1"><strong>F1:</strong> We sure have, Larry! First up, we’ve got the latest episode in the story of Harry Wish and Penny Pérez.</p>
                    <p class="texto_2"><strong>M1:</strong> You’ve probably heard how Harry and Penny got together last year, and since then, they’ve been in a volatile relationship that’s been up and down more times than anyone can count. Well, that hasn’t changed. Last weekend, they had a huge party in their Beverly Hills mansion, and everyone seemed to be having a wild time. That was until Harry got drunk and then got angry with many people at the party, including Penny!</p>
                    <p class="texto_1"><strong>F1:</strong> There were reports of a massive fight at the party, but there’s a happy ending too. Harry was seen at the mansion the next day with flowers and a mariachi band, trying to get Penny back!</p>
                    <p class="texto_2"><strong>M1:</strong>  I hope she listened to him! Our next story is about Starly Holiday. Luisa, did you see Starly’s last film?</p>
                    <p class="texto_1"><strong>F1:</strong> Well, I tried to get through it, but I just got bored and walked out of the cinema. And it looks like most of the people who went to see the film felt the same way, so it hasn’t made much money at all. Starly seems quite devastated about this reaction to the film: two nights ago, she was arrested by the police after driving erratically.</p>
                    <p class="texto_2"><strong>M1:</strong> Police reports say that they saw Starly driving very fast and without thinking about other drivers. You’ll never believe this, but when the police officers asked Starly to stop, she tried to get away from them! She didn’t get away, so when the police stopped her they arrested her. A statement from her agent says that Starly had got lost and didn’t see the police. What do you think about that, Luisa? </p>
                     <p class="texto_1"><strong>F1:</strong>  It doesn’t sound like a good excuse to me! Now Larry, you’re a big fan of Peter Martinez, aren´t you?</p>
                    <p class="texto_2"><strong>M1:</strong> He’s one of my favourite actors! I think everyone is used to seeing him now in movies and on TV!</p>
                    <p class="texto_1"><strong>F1:</strong>  Well, get ready for the latest news about him and his family! Peter has had some more problems with his mother recently. It seems that he just can’t get over his dispute with her, and now this has become very public. Do you remember that when he started as an actor, his mother was his agent? Now she’s saying that she’s responsible for all Peter’s success, and she wants more money from him. Just a few days ago, Peter was eating in a restaurant with his wife and children, and suddenly his mother arrived, and started shouting at everyone. The other customers in the restaurant were really shocked, and in the end the police had to take Peter’s mother away.</p>
                    <p class="texto_2"><strong>M1:</strong>  That’s terrible! I hope he can get over these problems soon and get on with his acting career!</p>
                    <p class="texto_1"><strong>F1:</strong> I hope so! We’re going to take a short break just now. We’ll be back in a few minutes with more exciting celebrity stories, right here on Celeb Shock!</p>
